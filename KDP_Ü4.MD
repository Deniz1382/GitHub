(a) Experimentally investigate how often one has to choose a random number between 1 and n until every number has appeared at least once. Conduct 100 experiments for n = 10, 100, and 1000, respectively, and determine the minimum, maximum, and average number of attempts for each n. An experiment consists of the necessary number of attempts until all numbers have been observed. (By the way, the expected value for the number of attempts is n(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n).)
```python 
import random

n = int(input("Enter the number:"))
def avr(n):
    attempt = 0
    numbers = list(range(1,n +1))
    def binary_search(numbers, random_number):
        n = len(numbers)

        def bin_search(left, right):
            if left >= right:  # Stop point: element not found
                return None
            m_pos = (left + right) // 2
            m = numbers[m_pos]

            if random_number == m:  # Found the number
                return m_pos
            elif random_number < m:  # Search left half
                return bin_search(left, m_pos)
            else:  # Search right half
                return bin_search(m_pos + 1, right)

        return bin_search(0, n)

    while numbers:
        random_number = random.randint(1, n)
        loc = binary_search(numbers, random_number)  # Get the position of the random number
        if loc is not None:
            del numbers[loc]  # Remove that number from the list
        attempt += 1  # increase the attempt counter each time

    return attempt
 avr_100_numbers = []
for i in range (1,100):
    attempt = avr(n)  # Call the function
    avr_100_numbers.append(attempt)
    print(f"Attempt {i}: {attempt}")
avr_100 = sum(avr_100_numbers) / len(avr_100_numbers)
min_100 = min(avr_100_numbers)
max_100 = max(avr_100_numbers)
print ("Average:" ,avr_100, "\nMinimun:", min_100, "\nMaximum:", max_100) # Output the average of attempts
